# 💼 AI + Finance Project Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of applied AI, data analytics, and finance projects. Each project demonstrates my ability to build practical solutions using Python, machine learning, web frameworks, and business logic.

📌 **Note:** Each project is contained in its own Git branch with all the necessary files to run it. Read the branch-specific README for setup and usage instructions.
